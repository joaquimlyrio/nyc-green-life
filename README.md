# Project 2: Open Data App - an RShiny app development project
### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)


In this second project of GU4243/GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the topic of green life in NYC using U.S. government open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

## Project Title: Green Life in NYC

+ **Project summary**: 
	+ Do you want to explore the distribution of air pollution in NYC, find a place to live or a garden to hang out with cleaner air? 
	+ Do you want to fight the problem of air pollution by avoiding the harmful fossil-fuel combustion of motor vehicles? 
	+ Air pollutants are more present in dense urban areas, and if New York City is anything, it's a dense urban area. This is why we've made this tool for you. We want to help you live a life in New York City and enjoy the benefits of an urban life while avoiding the problems associated with breathing bad air.
	+ We believe that living green is important, and we want to empower you live green. Enjoy our tool by clicking on this [link](https://wct2112.shinyapps.io/greenlivingnewyork/) and use it to learn how to live an environmentally friendly life. 	

+ **Data source**: 
	+ The air quality dataset can be found at [data.gov](https://data.ny.gov/)
